You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742

INFO:root:Verdict:
Your evaluation of the calculation for \(2^{10}\) is mostly correct, but there is a small error in the multiplication step. Here’s the corrected breakdown:

To calculate \(2^{10}\):

1. Start with \(2^1 = 2\).
2. \(2^2 = 2 \times 2 = 4\).
3. \(2^3 = 2 \times 4 = 8\).
4. \(2^4 = 2 \times 8 = 16\).
5. \(2^5 = 2 \times 16 = 32\).
6. \(2^6 = 2 \times 32 = 64\).
7. \(2^7 = 2 \times 64 = 128\).
8. \(2^8 = 2 \times 128 = 256\).
9. \(2^9 = 2 \times 256 = 512\).
10. Finally, \(2^{10} = 2 \times 512 = 1024\).

Alternatively, you can use the power operator directly:

\[
2^{10} = 1024
\]

So, the final answer is indeed:

**Answer: 1024.**
