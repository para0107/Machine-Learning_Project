        "content": "---\n\nProblem Type: Math.\n\nThe Archimedes' Principle states that the buoyancy force (or upthrust) on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. To understand this principle mathematically, let's consider an object partially or fully submerged in a fluid of density ρ and volume V. The weight of the fluid displaced can be calculated as W = ρVg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nNow, if we have an object of mass m and volume V' that is partially or fully submerged in the same fluid, the buoyancy force (Fb) acting on the object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. This can be expressed as Fb = ρVg, where V is the volume of the fluid displaced.\n\nTo find the relationship between the mass of the object and the buoyancy force, we need to consider the volume of the object and the density of the fluid. If the object has a density ρo, then its weight (mg) is given by mg = ρmV'g. \n\nBy equating the buoyancy force with the weight of the fluid displaced, we get Fb = ρVg = (ρm - ρo)V'g.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we can see that the buoyancy force on an object is directly proportional to the difference in density between the object and the surrounding fluid.\n\nAnswer: The buoyancy force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object."

However, upon inspection, it seems that the function `is_Power_Of_Two` is not correctly implementing the power of two check. A correct implementation would be:\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\ndef differ_at_one_bit_pos(a, b):\n    return is_power_of_two(a ^ b)\n```\n\nThis code works by using the fact that in binary representation, powers of two have exactly one '1' bit and all other bits are '0'. When you subtract 1 from a power of two, you flip all the bits after the leftmost '1' to '0', effectively clearing the rest of the '1's. Therefore, for any number n, if (n & (n - 1)) == 0, it means that n is a power of two.\n\nThe `differ_at_one_bit_pos` function checks whether the bitwise XOR of two numbers has exactly one bit set to '1', which would be the case if and only if they differ by exactly one bit."
