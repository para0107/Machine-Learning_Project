                "content": "Pythagoras, also known as Pythagorean theorem, is a fundamental concept in mathematics and geometry. It's a formula that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem states:\n\n**a² + b² = c²**\n\nWhere:\n\n* **a** is the length of one side (the base) of the right-angled triangle\n* **b** is the length of the other side (the height) of the right-angled triangle\n* **c** is the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle)\n\nIn simpler terms, if you square the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle and add them together, the result will be equal to the square of the length of the longest side.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a right-angled triangle with one side that's 3 units long (a) and another side that's 4 units long (b). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of the hypotenuse (c):\n\n**3² + 4² = c²**\n**9 + 16 = c²**\n**25 = c²**\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides:\n\n**c = √25**\n**c = 5**\n\nSo, in this example, the length of the hypotenuse is 5 units.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem has many practical applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, architecture, and computer science. It's a fundamental concept that helps us solve problems involving right-angled triangles.\n\nNow, let me ask you: Are you interested in learning how to implement this theorem in Python code? I can help with that!"
